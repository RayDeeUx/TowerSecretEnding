## Notes
- Rattledash's chest is not part of this mod.
- Since this mod relies on RobTop's official servers, you should not be using this on a private Geometry Dash server.
- If you see "Load Failed!" when entering any level at any point, you should fully restart the game (hopefully with a stable Internet connection by then).
- While this mod *can* be interpreted as a fangame mod, any moons, orbs, or coins you earn from completing a level in <cy>The Secret Ending</c> affects your save file for vanilla GD, since those rewards come from completing rated levels uploaded to RobTop's servers.
