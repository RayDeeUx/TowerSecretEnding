## Notes
- Since this mod relies on RobTop's official servers, you should not be using this on a private Geometry Dash server.
- If you see "Load Failed!" when entering a level at any point, that means you'll need to restart the game (hopefully with a stable Internet connection by then).
- While this mod *can* be interpreted as a fangame mod, this mod intentionally relies on your save data from vanilla GD and RobTop's servers. Any moons/orbs/coins you earn from completing <cy>The Secret Ending</c> are completely intentional and only affect your save file for vanilla GD, since this mod uses levels uploaded to RobTop's servers.
- Rattledash's chest is not part of this mod.
